Version 1.1-2 (October 2023)

	* Uploaded a new versions, as AlleleShift was archived because of a ongoing update
	in BiodiversityR

	* Included a reference to Brauer et al. 2023, Natural hybridization reduces
	vulnerability to climate change https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01585-1 as example
	of application.


Version 1.1 (September 2022)

Version 1-0-2 (August 2021)

	* Updated information on citation to the published article in PeerJ

	* Updated the documentation of the shift.surf.ggplot function to a Rpub that
	shows how a STAMEN baseline map can be used to produce high resolution images
	via the ggmap package.

Version 1.0-1 (25 March 2021)

	* Modified functions 'shift.dot.ggplot()' and 'shift.pie.ggplot()' to be able
	to handle data sets where all allele frequencies change in the same direction.

	* New function 'environmental.novel()' to identify populations with more
	extreme environmental values under climate change.


Version 0.9-1 (29 January 2021)

	* Moved 'amova.rda()' examples to 'dontrun' (example runs fine on a local
	machine).


Version 0.9 (January 2021)
